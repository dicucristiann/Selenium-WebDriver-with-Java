<p>With this, I have gained a good understanding of the basics of automation testing using Selenium WebDriver with Java, familiar with concepts of locators, web element actions, and assertion methods, and can handle different types of web elements.</p>
<p>Also, I am familiar with the use of Selenium Grid for distributed testing and have an understanding of the Page Object Model and its implementation.</p>
